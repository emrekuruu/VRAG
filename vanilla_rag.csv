Explanation: Based on the context provided, it is stated that the total value of the deemed claim given to employees was approximately $1.7 billion. Since this deemed claim was provided in exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, it can be inferred that the entire $1.7 billion deemed claim was labor-related.

Explanation:
To find the total mainline operating expenses in 2013, we need to sum up the aircraft fuel expense and calculate the percentage based on the given data in the table. 
In 2013, the aircraft fuel expense was $11,109 million, and it accounted for 35.4% of the total mainline operating expenses. 
Therefore, to find the total mainline operating expenses in 2013, we can set up the equation:
$11,109 million = 35.4% of total mainline operating expenses
Total mainline operating expenses = $11,109 million / 0.354 = $31,949 million",31381,['year the 2013 ( a ) of gallons is 3608 ; the 2013 ( a ) of average price per gallon is 3.08 ; the 2013 ( a ) of aircraft fuel expense is 11109 ; the 2013 ( a ) of percent of total mainline operating expenses is 35.4 ;']

To arrive at this answer, you would take the labor-related deemed claim amount for 2013, which is $1733 million, and divide it by the total reorganization items net amount for 2013, which is $2640 million.
