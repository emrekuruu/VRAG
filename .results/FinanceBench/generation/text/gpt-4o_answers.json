CVS Health's gross capital expenditures were approximately $2.7 billion in 2022. Additionally, the context mentions significant investments in technology, digital, and strategic initiatives, as well as store and facilities improvements.\n2 - Apply relevant financial analysis or logical reasoning: Capital-intensive businesses typically have high capital expenditures relative to their revenues and operating expenses. The total revenues for CVS Health in 2022 were $322.467 billion, and total operating costs were $314.721 billion. Comparing the capital expenditures to these figures gives an idea of capital intensity.\n3 - Synthesize findings to answer the question: The gross capital expenditures of $2.7 billion, while significant, are relatively small compared to the total revenues of $322.467 billion and total operating costs of $314.721 billion. This suggests that CVS Health is not highly capital-intensive as it spends a smaller proportion of its revenues on capital investments.",
