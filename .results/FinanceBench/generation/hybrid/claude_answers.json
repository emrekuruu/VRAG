The company's business model requires substantial infrastructure:\n- Manufacturing facilities for diverse product lines across Safety & Industrial, Transportation & Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer segments\n- Research and development facilities\n- Global distribution network\n- Automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes\n\n3. Financial indicators suggest capital intensity:\n- Regular need for significant capital expenditure ($1.5-1.8B forecast)\n- Strong balance sheet maintained to support capital needs\n- Investment in manufacturing efficiency and capacity is a key priority",
        "answer": "Yes, 3M is a capital-intensive business based on its substantial ongoing capital expenditure requirements ($1.5-1.8B forecast for 2023), extensive manufacturing infrastructure needs, and continuous investment in production facilities, equipment, and technology across its diverse business segments."

The key factors that drove this operating margin change in 2022 were:\n   - Increased cost of sales (+3.0%) due to higher materials and logistics costs\n   - Higher SG&A expenses (+6.1%) driven by significant litigation costs\n   - Declines in disposable respirator demand (-0.3% impact)\n   - Manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges\n   - Geopolitical impacts from Russia/Ukraine conflict\n   - COVID-related challenges\n\n3. These negative impacts were partially offset by:\n   - Benefits from strong pricing actions\n   - Spending discipline\n   - Restructuring actions\n   - Selling price increases\n\n4.

        "reasoning": "1. For financial services companies like American Express, traditional operating margin metrics are not the most relevant performance indicators because:\n   - Their business model is fundamentally different from traditional product/service companies\n   - Revenue and expenses are heavily tied to card member activity, rewards programs, and credit performance\n   - Key metrics include billed business volumes, credit metrics, and return metrics\n\n2. From the provided context, AMEX's performance is better evaluated through:\n   - Billed business growth (23% YoY increase in 2022)\n   - Revenue growth (25% YoY increase in 2022)\n   - Credit performance (metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels)\n   - Return on Equity (ROE)\n   - Net interest yield on card member loans\n\n3. Operating expenses for AMEX are highly variable and tied to:\n   - Card Member rewards and services (correlated to volumes)\n   - Business development expenses\n   - Marketing investments\n   - Technology and infrastructure investments\n   - These expenses are strategic investments rather than pure operational costs",
        "answer": "Operating margin is not a useful metric for evaluating American Express's performance. As a financial services company, AMEX's business model is based on card member spending, lending, and fee income, where traditional operating margin analysis doesn't capture the true dynamics of their business performance.

Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to directly calculate working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) for FY2022 as the complete balance sheet data is not provided.\n\n2. However, this may not be a critical limitation because working capital is likely not the most relevant metric for American Water Works Company due to its business model as a regulated utility company. Here's why:\n\n3. From the context, we can see that:\n   - The company is primarily a regulated water utility\n   - It has stable, recurring revenue streams\n   - It has significant long-term infrastructure assets\n   - It operates under regulatory oversight that helps ensure stable operations\n   - It has access to regulated rates and returns that help maintain financial stability\n\n4. In utility companies, working capital is often less meaningful because:\n   - They typically maintain minimal working capital due to the predictable nature of their business\n   - Their focus is on long-term infrastructure assets rather than short-term working capital\n   - Rate regulation helps ensure stable cash flows\n   - They have reliable access to capital markets for financing needs",
        "answer": "Working capital is not a particularly relevant metric for American Water Works Company given its business model as a regulated utility company. The company's financial health is better assessed through metrics related to long-term infrastructure assets, regulatory capital structure, and stable operating cash flows rather than short-term working capital."

        "answer": "Cannot determine based on the provided information. While there were decreased debt repayments in FY2023, the context doesn't provide the actual debt balances for both years to make a direct comparison."
