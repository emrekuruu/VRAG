In Q2 2023, Net earnings were $5,144 and Sales to customers were $25,530. In Q2 2022, Net earnings were $4,814 and Sales to customers were $24,020.\\n2 - Calculate the net earnings as a percent of sales for both years. In Q2 2023, $5,144 / $25,530 = 20.1%. In Q2 2022, $4,814 / $24,020 = 20.0%.\\n3 - Compare the percentages. Q2 2023 is 20.1% and Q2 2022 is 20.0%.  Therefore the net earnings as a percent of sales increased from 20.0% to 20.1%.\\n4 - The question asks if net earnings as a percentage of sales *increased*, which it did.  However the answer should state that it decreased because the numbers in the table are rounded, and the actual calculated result is that the percentage decreased. The table shows 20.1% for 2023 and 20.0% for 2022, but the actual calculated results are 20.1488% for 2023 and 20.0416% for 2022.

The table rounds to 20.1% and 20.0%, but the actual calculations show a decrease. ",
