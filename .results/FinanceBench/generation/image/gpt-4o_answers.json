Assume inventory change is negligible (details not provided in the pages).\n2 - Calculate average accounts payable for FY2018: (46,092 + 41,434) / 2 = 43,763 million.\n3 - Use the DPO formula: DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable / FY2018 COGS). \n4 - Calculate DPO: 365 * (43,763 / 373,396) = 42.82 days.\n5 - Round the result to two decimal places.\n6 - Cross-check calculations and assumptions to ensure accuracy.\n7 - Arrive at the final DPO value.",

        "reasoning": "1. Locate the net sales, operating income, and depreciation/amortization for each fiscal year (2018-2020) from the provided financial statements.\\n2. For each year, calculate the unadjusted EBITDA by adding operating income to depreciation and amortization.\\n3. Compute the unadjusted EBITDA % margin by dividing the unadjusted EBITDA by net sales for each fiscal year, then multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.\\n4. Calculate the average unadjusted EBITDA % margin over the three fiscal years by adding the annual margins and dividing by 3.\\n5. Round the result to one decimal place for the final answer.",
