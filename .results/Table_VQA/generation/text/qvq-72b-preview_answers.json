        "reasoning": "1. Identify the meaning of 'common stock equivalents' in the financial context, which refers to shares potentially convertible into common stock such as options and restricted stock units.\\n2. Examine the provided financial context about stock options, restricted stock awards, and the earnings per share (EPS) calculations.\\n3. Determine that diluted EPS considers potential dilution from outstanding options and restricted stock using the treasury stock method.\\n4. Understand that the treasury stock method involves using proceeds from exercising options to buy back shares, reducing dilution.\\n5. Recognize that the question seeks the number of common stock equivalents, meaning shares issued upon exercise of options and vesting of restricted stock units.\\n6. Identify cash proceeds from stock options in 2007 as $211.8 million but lack exercise prices to calculate shares.\\n7. Consider the intrinsic value of options exercised in 2007 as $91.0 million, but without exercise prices, the number of shares can't be derived.\\n8. Note irrelevant data about outstanding options as of 2009, which doesn't aid the 2007 calculation.",

Locate the relevant tables that contain financial data, specifically focusing on columns labeled by years. \n3. Examine the \"Change in cash and cash equivalents\" row to find the specific value for 2006. \n4. Observe that the value for 2006 is $47.9 million, which is a positive number, indicating a net increase. \n5.

The ending balance on December 29, 2013, is $30,210, which initially suggests that the valuation allowance might be $30,210.\n5. Check the second table which summarizes the Q3 2012 Plan activity and notes a balance at December 29, 2013, as $3,758.\n6. The question specifically asks for the valuation allowance on December 29, 2013, and the most relevant figure from the tables provided is $30,210.",

'Target weighted average asset allocation' refers to the planned distribution of assets among categories like equities, fixed income, and real estate.\n3. The table mentioned provides percentages for 'actual' and 'target' allocations across four years, but the years aren't specified.\n4. 'Current' is ambiguous without knowing which year is considered 'current' by the company. A reasonable assumption is the most recent year provided in the table.\n5. The table caption indicates the presence of both actual and target percentages for each year.\n6. Given data shows fixed income percentages: 55%, 33%, 55.0%, and presumably 5% for years 1 to 4.\n7. Despite potential typos, it's inferred that the most recently provided percentage for fixed income is the 'current' target.\n8. Assuming the most recent complete data, the 'current' target for fixed income is 55.0%.",

For 2007, the depreciation and amortization expense (additions) is 81,318.\n3. For 2008, the depreciation and amortization expense (additions) is 115,158.\n4. Use the percentage change formula: Percentage change = [(new value - old value) / old value] * 100%.\n5. Substitute the values into the formula: [(115,158 - 81,318) / 81,318] * 100%.\n6. Calculate the difference: 115,158 - 81,318 = 33,840.\n7. Divide the difference by the 2007 expense: 33,840 / 81,318 = 0.416.\n8. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.416 * 100% = 41.6%.",
